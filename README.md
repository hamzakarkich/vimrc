To configure your `.vimrc` on Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Home Directory:**
   Open a terminal and go to your home directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

2. **Create or Edit `.vimrc`:**
   If you already have a `.vimrc` file, you can edit it. Otherwise, create one using a text editor. For example:

   ```bash
   vim .vimrc
   ```

   This will open the file in Vim for editing.

3. **Configure Vim Settings:**
   Add or modify configurations according to your preferences. Here are a few common settings:

   - Set line numbers:
     ```vim
     set number
     ```

   - Enable syntax highlighting:
     ```vim
     syntax enable
     ```

   - Set the default tab size to 4 spaces:
     ```vim
     set tabstop=4
     set shiftwidth=4
     set expandtab
     ```

   - Highlight search results as you type:
     ```vim
     set incsearch
     ```

   - Enable mouse support:
     ```vim
     set mouse=a
     ```

4. **Save and Exit:**
   Save your changes and exit Vim by pressing `Esc` to enter command mode, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

   If you created a new `.vimrc` file, you might need to restart Vim for the changes to take effect.

Now your Vim configuration is updated according to the settings you specified in your `.vimrc` file
